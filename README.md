# PowerBi_LocalTour_1
Practicing data visualization with Power BI using a free data from kaggle. This time I'm using a local themed data, tourism data in Java, Indonesia. I've uploaded dataset in this repository but please refer [here](kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination) for the original source. 

## Method
The data is relatively clean, so it was already very easy to use. But I did some adjustments so i can visualize the data in a way that is informative. For example, the **user** table had a **Location** column which contains the city and the province of the users. The data would be too *noisy* and if we categorize the user in that way, so i chose to extract the province name.
